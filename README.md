Hello all!
I am Rohan Choudhary,student of IIT Bombay here addressing you all.I will narrate all my work I did in my mentee tenure with SOC project - 'Loan Approval Prediction using ML'. In my **week 1** I learnt basics of Python like list,tuple,dictionary,set,etc. also some of there attributes and did the assignment. [05/05/2022-12/05/2022]

Next I did **week 2** in which I learnt some of the libraries of python which were relevant for this project. Libraries were Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Numpy are used to create n-dimentional array, Pandas help in creating and managing dataframe, matplotlib is used to create graphs,charts,plots,etc. - [12/05/2022-19/05/2022]

In week 3, I tried to understand what is Machine Learning and python's application in ML. - [10/07/2022]

In week 4, The most important thing I learnt was about Data Cleaning. Basically I understood how missing data in a given dataset can be handeled, which type of data should be filled with what algorithms and so on. - [26/07/2022]

In week 5, I handeled the given dataset and first did its data cleaning and filled missing values using some ways. And for data like male/female(categorical data), we filled 1/0 inorder to incorporate them as well in calculation. Finally used 2-3 ML algorithms to check accuracy of the data analysis we did. ML algorithms included Logistic Regression, KNN, etc. - [26/07/2022-28/07/2022]

Overall it was pretty good course, I could start with Machine Learning, my first step into it, with the help of this SOC project and great Mentors (Utkarsha Patil was really regular throughout).
